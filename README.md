Take all the goodness of node.js: the non-blocking asynchronous program model,
and the packaging system, and do it in Java 7 using asynchronos sockets from NIO.2
and use Equinox with p2 as the packaging system, shake and stir and see if
it works and whether a community forms from it, which, BTW,
is actually the best thing about node.js.
